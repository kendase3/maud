### Maud
Who was that Maud person, anyway?

Maud is for people who like to tinker with NetHack and who have amnesia.  Maud is a project aimed at making building NetHack and hosting a NetHack server easier.  For now it can't do much.

## To build nethack via a docker container:
`sudo bash build`

## To play nethack via a docker container:
`sudo bash play`

## To mess around in the build environment non-destructively:
`sudo bash dev`

Have fun and send patches!
